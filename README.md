# Reimplement-depth-map-prediction

Implementation of Depth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network.


If running locally install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the neural network with `python neural_networks.py`

Optionally, run the Python Notebook in Google Colab. If using Google Colab, GPU hardware acceleration is recommmended. 

Running the neural network requires the NYU Depth V1 dataset (`nyu_depth_data_labeled.mat`) which can be downloaded from: https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/datasets/nyu_depth_v1.html
